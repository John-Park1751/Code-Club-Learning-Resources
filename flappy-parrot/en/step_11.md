## What next?

Try the [Binary hero](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/binary-hero?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project, where you will make a game in which you play the notes of a song as they scroll down the Stage.

--- no-print ---

Click the green flag to start the game. Use the <kbd>z</kbd>, <kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>c</kbd>, and <kbd>v</kbd> keys to play the correct notes when these reach the bottom of the Stage. You'll score ten points for every correct note you play.

The notes will fall from above, and you will have to press keys to "catch" and play the notes.
