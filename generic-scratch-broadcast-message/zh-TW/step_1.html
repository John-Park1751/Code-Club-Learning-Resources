        <p>A broadcast is a way of sending a signal from a sprite which can be heard by all sprites. Think of it like an announcement made over a loudspeaker.</p>
<h3>Send a broadcast</h3>
<p>You can send a broadcast by creating a broadcast block and giving it a name.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find the broadcast block in the Events tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>new message</strong> in the drop-down menu, then type your message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Create a broadcast" src="images/create-a-broadcast.png"/></p>
<p>The message text can be anything you like, but it is useful to give the broadcast a sensible description. What happens when the message is received depends on the code you write.</p>
<h3>Receive a broadcast</h3>
<p>A sprite can react to a broadcast by using this block:</p>
<p><img alt="Receive a broadcast" src="images/receive-a-broadcast.png"/></p>
<p>You can add blocks below this block to tell the sprite what to do when it receives the broadcast signal.</p>
<p><img alt="Receive example" src="images/receive-example.png"/></p>
